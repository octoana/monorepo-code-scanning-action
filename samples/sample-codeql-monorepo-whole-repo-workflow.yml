# This workflow scans all sub projects of a monorepo.
# 
# It uses Actions from `advanced-security/monorepo-code-scanning-action`
#
# The specific language and paths covered by each project are passed to the CodeQL analysis, along with a custom analysis workflow if one is provided.
#
# For TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, and Ruby, and when using 'build-mode: none' for Java and C#, you can let the CodeQL Action handle the "build" step,
# and only target the project that is being changed by the PR.
#
# For Kotlin, Swift and C/C++, or when not using 'build-mode: none' for Java and C#, you will need to manually build the project,
# in a way that you can define in the optional custom analysis workflow.
#
# If you want to specifiy custom queries, you can do so in the custom analysis workflow.
#
# You can find an example of what that looks like in this repository at .github/workflows/custom-codeql-analysis.yml
